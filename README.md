Reflection on course

The Discrete Structure course has provide the introduction of the mathematical concept related to computer science field. Through the study of sets and relations, theconcepts have been applied to design data structures and algorithms. The course developed in logical reasoning, problem-solving, and mathematical proofs hence provided a deeper understanding of the structures that support computation and data processing.
